MongoDB Query to Retrieve Products by Category (Electronics):

db.products.find({ category: "Electronics" })
  .sort({ price: -1 })
  .skip(0);
  .limit(5);

- skip value will change depending on the page

To optimize the query:
We can add an index on the category and price fields.
This will speed up filtering by category and sorting by price, especially as the dataset grows.
Indexes help MongoDB find and sort documents much faster than scanning the entire collection.
